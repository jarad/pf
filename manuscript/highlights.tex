{\bf Highlights} \\
\
\begin{itemize}
\item We simulate an epidemic using an SIR model and generate syndromic data from multiple sources.
\item We compare the performance of three different particle filtering algorithms on the simulated data.
\item The algorithm that resamples values of the fixed parameters outperforms the other two algorithms that do not.
\item Over-restrictive uniform priors influence the estimate of the posterior distribution of the unknown parameters.
\item Multinomial resampling of particles is outperformed by more sophisticated resampling techniques.
\end{itemize}
